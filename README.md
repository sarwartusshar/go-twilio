## Development

There are currently two commands which should be used:
`make build` - compiles the `src/main.go` file and places the binary in `bin/`  
`make run` - compiles the binary if they isn't already and runs the program 
without parameters.

There is an `.editorconfig` with convenient settings, make sure your editor 
respects these file.
